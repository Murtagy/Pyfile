# Pyfile
Simple python web-server to browse files on your machine in local network. 
Uses Bottle framework as one of the most light-weight frameworks, served with Waitress web-server to be multi-threaded.

Features:  
   -open files  
   -open directories  
   -create file, substitute content of the file  
   -upload/download  
   -syntax high-highlighting (embed highight.js )  
   -basic authentication on user/password   
   -no delete (add it if you want)  

Integrate it, develop it, push it to YOUR limit! :)
   
My personal use of it was as a UI to inner ETL solution. The ETL-UI part was cut off.

!Attention!
  I didn't put much effort in security. So you shouldn't put it in web
  (it's vulnerable to coockie stealing/brutforce)
  
  
  Run server.py to start!
